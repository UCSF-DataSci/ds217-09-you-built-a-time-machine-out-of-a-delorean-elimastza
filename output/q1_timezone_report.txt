TODO: Document your timezone operations:
- What timezone was your original data in?
- How did you localize the data?
- What timezone did you convert to?
- What issues did you encounter with DST? (Note: Using UTC avoids DST ambiguity)
- Include at least one example showing a datetime before and after conversion
- Explain why UTC is recommended as the base timezone for storing temporal data

Original time zone: The original time zone of the Healthcare Time Series Dataset was in UTC  
Here is an example of the original time zone timestamp:  2023-03-12 10:00:00+00:00
Converted time zone: The converted time zone was in US eastern time -  US/Eastern
Here is an example of the converted time zone timestamp in the dataset:2023-03-12 06:00:00-04:00
To localize the dataset, a function was used. The function tz_localize('UTC') was used to localize the time zone to 'UTC.

Issues encountered in DST Handling: There were minimal issues in handling daylight saving time transitions because there are little to no ambiguity issues when using UTC. Because there are no issues with day light savings, UTC is typically preferred as a basic time zone prior to localization or conversion. This is especially helpful when analyzing or handling temporal data as this type of data is used to identify trends and patterns. Challenges with day light savings may influence potential trends and patterns, especially when looking at weather trends or seasonal trends. For this dataset, it may be related to patient temperatures.

For this reason, UTC is the recommended base time zone for storing temporal data.

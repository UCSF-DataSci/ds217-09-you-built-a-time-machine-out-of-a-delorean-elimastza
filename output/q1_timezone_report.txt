TODO: Document your timezone operations:
- What timezone was your original data in?
- How did you localize the data?
- What timezone did you convert to?
- What issues did you encounter with DST? (Note: Using UTC avoids DST ambiguity)
- Include at least one example showing a datetime before and after conversion
- Explain why UTC is recommended as the base timezone for storing temporal data

Original timezone:UTC 
Example UTC time: 2023-03-12 10:00:00+00:00
Converted timezone: US/Eastern
Example Converted time: 2023-03-12 06:00:00-04:00
Localization method: Used tz_localize('UTC') to set timezone to UTC.

Issues encountered in DST Handling: None, as UTC avoids DST ambiguity issues.

UTC is the recommended base timezone for storing temporal data because it avoids complications with daylight savings.
